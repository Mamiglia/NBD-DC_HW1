Homework#1 for Networking for Big Data. Sapienza 2022/23


## Part 1
1. scripts for generating _p-ER_ and _r-regular random graphs_, with param K = number of nodes
2. scripts for checking that the graphs are fully connected:

   1. Irreducibilty (numpy?) [ref](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/2682461/1051217)
   2. Laplacian (numpy?)
   3. BFS
  
1. Compare complexity for all the previous functions, as a function of K, then plot
2. let $p_C$ be the probability that a given graph is connected, now by running Monte Carlo simulations:
  
    1. find $p_C$ for p-ER graphs when K=100
    2. plot $p_C$ for r-regular graphs with r=2 and r=8 for any $K \leq 100$


## Part 2
1. Scripts for building specific topologies: (Not specified but necessary for later steps?)
   1. Fat-Tree
   2. Jellyfish
2. Algorithm for evaluating Mean Response Time $R$ of a certain graph (simulations or calculations..?)
3. Plot $E[R]$ as a function of N, for $1 \leq N \leq 10000$
4. Plot $S$ as a function of N
5. Explainations, analysis and takeaways
